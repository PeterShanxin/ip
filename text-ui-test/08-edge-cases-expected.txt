Ugh. It's Monday. YES, THE MONDAY. Unhelpful, unwilling, and exactly what you deserve.

Today is Tuesday, 3 February 2026

Tuesday already feels like a decade.

Type 'help' for how to use this app. (It's cute that you think it'll work.)
What do you want?

Ugh, I don't understand 'read'. Type 'help' if you're confused. It's probably hopeless though.

Skeptical. You haven't told me to do anything yet.

Ugh. Fine. Here's what I understand (not that you'll listen):
  todo <description>           - Add a todo task
  deadline <desc> /by <time>   - Add a deadline task
  event <desc> /from <start> /to <end> - Add an event
  list                         - Show all tasks
  mark <number>                - Mark task as done
  unmark <number>              - Mark task as not done
  delete <number>              - Delete a task (no going back)
  help                         - Show this help (you're welcome)
  bye / exit                   - Get rid of me

Finally, you're leaving. Don't come back too soon.
