Ugh. It's Monday. YES, THE MONDAY. Unhelpful, unwilling, and exactly what you deserve.

Happy hump day. Not.

Type 'help' for how to use this app. It's cute that you think it'll work.
What do you want?

Ugh, I don't understand 'read'. Type 'help' if you're confused. It's probably hopeless though.

Skeptical. You haven't told me to do anything yet.

Ugh. Fine. Here's what I understand (not that you'll listen):
  todo <description>           - Add a todo task
  deadline <desc> /by <time>   - Add a deadline task
  event <desc> /from <start> /to <end> - Add an event
  list                         - Show all tasks
  mark <number>                - Mark task as done
  unmark <number>              - Mark task as not done
  help                         - Show this help (you're welcome)
  bye / exit                   - Get rid of me
