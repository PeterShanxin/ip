# MONDAY User Guide

MONDAY is a grumpy but efficient task manager for power users who prefer keyboard commands over mouse clicks. Named after everyone's least favorite day of the week, MONDAY has a sarcastic personality but gets the job done.

## Adding tasks

Add a task by typing any text that isn't a command. MONDAY will reluctantly remember it for you.

Example: `read book`

Expected output:

```
added: read book
```

Notes:
- MONDAY can store up to 100 tasks
- Empty input (just spaces) will be rejected with a grumpy error message
- Task descriptions can contain spaces and any characters

## Listing tasks

View all your tasks by typing `list`.

Example: `list`

Expected output:

```
1. read book
2. return book
```

Notes:
- Tasks are displayed with numbered list format
- If you haven't added any tasks yet, MONDAY will be skeptical about it
- The `list` command is case-insensitive (works with LIST, List, lIsT, etc.)
